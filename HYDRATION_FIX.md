# Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
The error "In HTML, `<button>` cannot be a descendant of `<button>`. This will cause a hydration error." was occurring in the DataTable component.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by nested `<button>` elements in the DataTable component:

1. **Row Actions Dropdown**: The `DropdownMenuTrigger` component renders a `<button>` element, and we were passing a `Button` component (which also renders a `<button>`) as a child using the `asChild` prop.

2. **Column Visibility Dropdown**: Same issue with the column visibility dropdown.

## Solution
Fixed the nested button issue by:

1. **Removed `asChild` prop**: Instead of using `asChild` with a `Button` component, we now use the `DropdownMenuTrigger` directly with appropriate styling.

2. **Updated styling**: Applied the necessary CSS classes directly to the `DropdownMenuTrigger` to maintain the same visual appearance.

3. **Fixed component props**: Updated other components to use the correct prop names:
   - `Checkbox`: Changed `onCheckedChange` to `onChange`
   - `Select`: Changed `onValueChange` to `onChange`
   - `DropdownMenuContent`: Removed unsupported `align` prop

## Code Changes

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
<DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
  <Button variant="ghost" className="h-8 w-8 p-0">
    <MoreHorizontal className="h-4 w-4" />
  </Button>
</DropdownMenuTrigger>
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
<DropdownMenuTrigger className="h-8 w-8 p-0 hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground">
  <MoreHorizontal className="h-4 w-4" />
</DropdownMenuTrigger>
```

## Result
- ✅ No more nested button elements
- ✅ No hydration errors
- ✅ Same visual appearance and functionality
- ✅ Proper accessibility with screen readers
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved

## Testing
The fix has been tested and verified:
- No linting errors
- No TypeScript errors
- Components render correctly
- Dropdown functionality works as expected
- No hydration warnings in the browser console

This fix ensures that the DataTable component works correctly in both server-side rendering and client-side hydration without any HTML validation issues.
